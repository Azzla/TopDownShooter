# TopDownShooter
My first ever, disastrously organized, minimally scoped LOVE2D game.  Written in LUA.

Uses camera.lua from the hump-master library, anim8-master for animation, and simple-tiled-implementation for tilesets.

## Movement:
WASD keys to move.  Space key to dash.

## Shoot:
Mouse to aim, mouse1 to fire.

## Shop Info:
```
"L_Shift" to open the shop.  "Z" to purchase attack, "X" to purchase speed, "C" to purchase fire rate, "V" to purchase magnet.
```
```
"B" to purchase +25% health.
```

## Acknowledgements:
- Anim8.lua framework for sprite animation.
- hump-camera.lua for camera control and rendering.
- tween.lua for tweening animations.
- SimpleTI framework for tilemaps and background rendering.
